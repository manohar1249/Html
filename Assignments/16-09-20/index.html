                    </h4>
                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">"Sir, it is a misnomer that rummy is a game of skill. It is gambling and betting money through rummy in the greed of getting more is illegal as it ruins families financially and otherwise.  It is unfortunate that many have become addicts, particularly in south India," he said during his special mention in the Upper House.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">"I don''t see any industry that can grow at this pace in the world, including Apple, Amazon, etc. This clearly indicates the rapidity with which online real money gaming, which includes rummy, is spreading," he said.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and the Indian team walked out a meet of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization hosted by Russia after Pakistan used a doctored map as a background for its representative. The map showed Indian territories as part of Pakistan. The Indian side's move was a protest against Pakistan's blatant violation of norms, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday.<br>
                        Asked about the issue, ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in a statement: "The Pakistani NSA deliberately projected a fictitious map that Pakistan has recently been propagating. This was in blatant disregard to the advisory by the host (Russia) against it and in violation of the norms of the meeting."
